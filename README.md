# 🏥 Region H – Bedside Tablet Redesign
### A Human‑Centered, AI‑Assisted Patient Experience for Emergency Departments

## 📌 Overview  
This project is our submission for the **Region H (Region Hovedstaden) Open Innovation Challenge 2026**.  
The core challenge:  
> *“How might we design accessible and high‑quality digital solutions for Emergency Department patients that ensure equality, dignity, and leave no one behind?”*

Current bedside tablets provide many digital functions, but **up to 43% of ED patients struggle to use smartphones or digital interfaces** — making them vulnerable to exclusion, stress, and misunderstanding.

Our solution delivers a **refined, accessibility‑first UI/UX** paired with **AI‑assisted guidance**, giving all patients — especially elderly and frail individuals — an easier and more dignified digital experience.

## 🎯 Problem Summary  
Based on Region H’s documentation:

- **43% of emergency patients cannot use digital tools or understand digital information.**  
- ED patients are often **frail, stressed, in pain, or disoriented**, reducing their ability to navigate complex UIs.  
- Staff face **heavy time pressure** and cannot teach every patient how to use the tablet. 
- Bedside tablets have many features today, with even more coming (environment control, differentiated patient call). 
- Without redesign, the digital divide will continue to affect equality and dignity for vulnerable patients.

## 💡 Our Solution  
A redesigned bedside tablet experience built on **universal design**, **simplicity**, and **AI assistance**.

### ✔ 1. Accessibility‑Driven UI/UX Redesign  
- High contrast, large buttons, clear typography  
- Simplified navigation with only essential features visible initially  
- Reduced cognitive load through step‑by‑step flows  
- Visual cues and friendly micro‑interactions  
- WCAG‑inspired universal design principles

### ✔ 2. AI‑Powered Patient Assistant  
The AI assistant helps patients by:  
- Explaining instructions and features in natural language  
- Guiding them through tasks step‑by‑step  
- Translating content for non‑Danish speakers  
- Understanding typed or spoken needs (e.g., “I need water”, “I’m in pain”)  
- Supporting future "differentiated patient call" workflows defined by Region H

All AI interactions in this prototype are simulated (no backend).

### ✔ 3. Future‑Ready for Region H Features  
Our UI is compatible with upcoming bedside tablet capabilities:  
- **Room Environment Control** (lights, curtains, temperature)  
- **Differentiated Patient Call** (specific request categories)
